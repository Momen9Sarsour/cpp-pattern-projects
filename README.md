# ⭐ C++ Pattern Printing Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects focused on **pattern printing using stars, numbers, and shapes**.  
These projects strengthen concepts such as **loops, nested loops, conditions, and logic building**, making them essential for beginners in problem-solving and algorithm design.

## 📂 Project Structure
Each project is organized inside a separate folder:

cpp-pattern-projects/
│── pattern-triangle/
│ ├── main.cpp
│ └── README.md
│── pattern-diamond/
│ ├── main.cpp
│ └── README.md
│── pattern-numbers/
│ ├── main.cpp
│ └── README.md

## 📝 What You Will Learn
- Nested loops  
- Controlling patterns with rows & columns  
- Generating geometric shapes  
- Using conditions inside loops  
- Improving logic thinking  

---

## 🧩 Examples of Included Patterns
- Right-angle star triangle  
- Pyramid star shape  
- Inverted triangle  
- Number increasing patterns  
- Number pyramid  
- Mixed star-number patterns  

> Each project folder contains a **detailed README** explaining the pattern, input, logic, and output.

## ▶️ How to Run Any Project
1. Open the folder of the project you want  
2. Open `main.cpp`  
3. Compile using a C++ compiler:

### **Using g++**
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o pattern
./pattern
